## A graphical journal

"An autobiography is meant to be an account of a person’s life, but, on the whole, you’re not going to get [a painting] that is a straight description of someone's life
 — it’s usually an essence of that. Say you’re making a cake and you have various different ingredients — 
 you put eggs in it. But the cake is very different from its ingredients; you don’t say that the cake 
 is an account of the eggs. Yet you couldn’t make it without the eggs." - <a href='https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/spectacular-endlessly-an-interview-with-emily-berry/'>Emily Berry </a>


These are some of the illustrations I've made since I first started painting in 2019. I've arranged them in a semi-chronological order, starting with the first 2 I've ever painted.
