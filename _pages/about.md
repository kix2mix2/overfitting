title: About
subtitle: I am an independent data scientist and consultant. I've spent the last couple years in a London-based start-up delivering custom ML solutions. More recently, I have been researching automatic visualization design as part of the <a href='https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/universitaet/aktuelles/meldungen/diversity-intelligent-durch-vielfalt/visvar/'> VISUS </a>  team.

## Main interests

My aim is to simplify the data visualization and analysis design process so that it is accessible to the many, not just the few. 

My approach is focused on applying **recommender systems**, **probabillistic modelling** and more widely, machine learning to **automatize visualization design**.

In my research, I try to understand and simulate low level human cognition tasks, such as visual perception. To that end, many of my projects involve **human-interface design**, **crowd-sourcing** , and **human-in-the-loop (active learning) systems.**
